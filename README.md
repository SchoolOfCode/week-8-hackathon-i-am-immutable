# Hackathon 8: I-AM-IMMUTABLE

## Our task was to design a React based webpage application from scratch using some of the skills we have learnt in this bootcamp so far.

### Some of the skills we have tried to use are; Fetching an API, using useState(), useReducer() and CSS styling.

#### Running the app:

1. To run the app open the terminal and run `npm i`, then `npm run dev`.

2. Next open another terminal, change directories into the backend by doing `cd backend`. After that, run `npm i`, then `npm start`.

3. Open up your preferred browser and type `http://localhost:5173/` in the search bar, press enter and you should see the website!

4. Enjoy job hunting!
